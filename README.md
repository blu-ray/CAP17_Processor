## CAP17_Processor Verilog 

# CAD Final Project , CISC architecture 
-------------------
In this project, we implement CAD Course Final Project (CAP17 Processor) with CISC architecture in Verilog HDL 

This processor can support this instructions.

# Example
-------------------
An example, a sample program that divide 128 to 4 has been pre writen into the memory.
The result has been stored in the Data2 Register.
